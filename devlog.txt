Finished the basic summary page that I started in class. (Could still change depending on the format the variables are passed to the webpage. Also going to have to figure out how to center the text vertically)

Fixed site crashing when no cost is given
Fixed API bugs and unsuccessully tried to implement images for restruants

reoK -- 2016-12-14 22:22
add a button to summary.html that sends a form to new route '/addPlan'
created databaseIO.py that writes to and reads from tables in data.db
'/addPlan' route receives hidden form info (of event + eatery), saves it to
users table, and redirects to home

used databaseIO in the home route to display all the plan from logged-in user's database table
checks to see if table is empty; if so, shows message instead
